**Introduction**
This SQL project focuses on analyzing key metrics related to user engagement and app performance across various time periods. The primary objective is to derive insights that can inform strategic decisions for enhancing user experience and optimizing app functionality.

The code encompasses several crucial analyses:

**Daily Active Users (DAU) Comparison**: It compares the average DAU of all apps across two selected time periods, calculating the percentage change in user engagement. This helps identify trends in user retention and activity.

**Daily User Metrics**:  The project retrieves detailed daily metrics, including new users, users who muted notifications, the unmute rate, and DAU. This data provides a granular view of user interactions and behaviors.

**Monthly Active Users (MAU):** It calculates the average MAU by determining the maximum monthly active users for the specified app, offering insights into long-term user engagement.

**Page Views Analysis**: The average number of page views is calculated for two distinct periods, allowing for an evaluation of user engagement with specific features of the app.

**Weekly Active Users and Loyal Users**: The project retrieves data on weekly active users and loyal users, helping to assess user commitment over time.

**Total Clicks**: Finally, it calculates the total number of clicks within the app, providing a measure of overall user interaction.

By synthesizing these metrics, the project aims to present a comprehensive overview of user engagement patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making to enhance app performance and user satisfaction.
