As part of my MSc at Nottingham Trent University, I independently developed a comprehensive market entry strategy for Cong Ca Phe, a fast-growing Vietnamese coffee chain with a strong presence across Asia and North America. The project aimed to assess the feasibility and design a strategic plan for expanding into the UK market—leveraging the brand's cultural heritage and unique product offerings to stand out in a highly competitive industry. 

The project was awarded a 9/10 score for its analytical depth, strategic clarity, and practical action plan. 

Skills: Market Research and Analysis, Strategic Recommendations, Visualisation & Presentations 

 
**Key Findings**:  

- **Sustainable Competitive Advantage**: Cong Ca Phe’s core resources—authentic Vietnamese coffee, nostalgic ambiance, strong brand identity, and structured franchise operations—are valuable, rare, inimitable, and well-organized (VRIO). These capabilities support a defensible position in international markets. 

- **Target Market Alignment**: The UK’s multicultural population and the growing interest among Gen Z in global, culturally immersive coffee experiences align well with Cong Ca Phe’s unique value proposition. 

- **Franchising as the Optimal Entry Strategy**: Successfully implemented in South Korea, Malaysia, Canada, and Taiwan. Franchisees manage operations and investment, reducing financial risk for the parent company. Enables scalable, rapid expansion in new international markets. 

**Recommended 5-Phase Action Plan** 

- Phase 1: Conduct local feasibility studies and demographic research. 

- Phase 2: Develop a UK-specific franchise business model and training program. 

- Phase 3: Prepare legal agreements and ensure IP, recipe, and branding protections. 

- Phase 4: Recruit and onboard qualified UK-based franchisees. 

- Phase 5: Launch a pilot location and assess performance before broader rollout.
