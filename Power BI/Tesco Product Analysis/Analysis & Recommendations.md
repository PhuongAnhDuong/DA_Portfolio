Recent market trends indicate that in-store shopping continues to dominate, particularly among middle- and lower-income consumers who prioritize perceived value (Mintel 2024). This shift reveals that consumers are increasingly moving away from a sole focus on price to a more comprehensive understanding of value that includes quality, variety, and sustainability.
Tesco, as the third-largest supermarket chain globally and the leading grocery retailer in the UK, is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends. 
To capture this prospect, the report outlines two key strategies: 

- Enhancing brand-owned products
- Improving communication about product details

Utilizing a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative and qualitative analyses of Tesco's Finest brand products and customer insights, the report identifies a critical opportunity for Tesco to enhance its product offeringsâ€”particularly in the Fresh Food category. Furthermore, enhancing the in-store experience by providing detailed product information through technology, such as QR codes and electronic shelf labels, is recommended. These initiatives are designed to foster customer loyalty and satisfaction, particularly among value-conscious shoppers.
